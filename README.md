# Moving Picture Interface
 
In your projectâ€™s README, please include details about the following:

- Utilized RXJS stores/selectors/pipes to move async logic away from components
- Images are optimized by intercepting the src attribute with an Image Loader, which replaces it with a smaller source as per aws media parameters
- Deep linking works on all application pages

What I would like to improve:

- Loading spinners for components in-progress
- Error handling
