# Moving Picture Interface
 
This is an angular application that integrates with a movies API.

Try it here: [Moving Picture Interface App](https://mdiehr.github.io/MoviesApp/)

- RXJS stores/selectors/pipes move async logic away from components
- If the service can't be reached, redirects user to an error handling page
- Images sources are optimized with a custom Image Loader
- Deep linking works on all pages
- Automatic build/deploy to GitHub pages via Github Actions

What I would like to improve:

- Loading spinners for components in-progress
- More/better error handling
- Unit testing
